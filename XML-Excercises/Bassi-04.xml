Booker T.
Was a practical man.
He said, <lesson type="perseverance">Till the soil
And learn from the land.
Let down your bucket
Where you are.</lesson>
Your fate is here
And not afar.
To help yourself
And your fellow man,
<lesson type="education">Train your head,
Your heart, and your hand.</lesson>
For smartness alone's
Surely not meet—
If you haven't at the same time
Got something to eat.
</part>
<part n="2">
Thus at Tuskegee
He built a school
With book-learning there
And the workman's tool.
He started out
In a simple way—
For yesterday
Was not today.
Sometimes he had
Compromise in his talk—
<lesson type="patience">For a man must crawl
Before he can walk</lesson>
</part>—
<part n="3">
And in Alabama in '85
A joker was lucky
To be alive.
But Booker T.
Was nobody's fool:
You may carve a dream
With an humble tool.
<lesson type="modesty">The tallest tower
Can tumble down
If it be not rooted
In solid ground.</lesson>
</part>
<part n="4">
So, being a far-seeing
Education and Outreach Division
Practical man,
He said, <lesson type="education">Train your head,
Your heart, and your hand.</lesson>
Your fate is here
And not afar,
<lesson type="perseverance">So let down your bucket
Where you are.</lesson>
